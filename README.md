1. Visit [Google Account Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Enable 2-Step Verification (mandatory)
3. Go to **App Passwords**
4. Choose:
    - App: Mail
    - Device: Custom name (e.g., "Bulk Mailer")
5. Click **Generate**
6. Copy the 16-character password
7. Use it in the app instead of your regular password

> This password is safe to use in applications and keeps your account secure.
